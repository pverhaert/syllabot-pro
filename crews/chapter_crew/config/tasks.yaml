          Fault: ... "content here" ... (no backslash in front of " -> escape it)
          Good: ... \"content here\" ... (backslash in front of " -> do nothing)
    - Preserve all original content exactly as provided
    - Maintain the JSON structure of the content
    - Never modify the actual content or meaning
