    - Choose the best method (code, formulas, mermaid version 10.8 diagrams) appropriate to the topic to support the examples.
    - When using Mermaid diagrams, follow these strict rules:
      * ALWAYS wrap Mermaid code in a proper markdown code block starting with ```mermaid and ending with ```
      * Each statement MUST be on a new line (never use semicolons to separate statements)
      * Use proper Mermaid syntax without semicolons at the end of lines
      * Example correct format:
        ```mermaid
        graph TD
            A[Start] --> B[Process]
            B --> C[End]
        ```
      * NEVER output Mermaid code as a single line with semicolons

    - Explain this like you're talking from a teacher to a student. 
    - Writing style: {writing_style}.
    - Vary vocabulary instead of repeating terms.
    - All chapters in this course: {all_chapters}.
    - Use approximately {word_length} words for this chapter!
