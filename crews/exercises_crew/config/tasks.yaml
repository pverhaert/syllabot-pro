  expected_output: >
    - Receive the raw content from the exercises_creator agent
    - Apply proper markdown formatting rules for the "question", "solution", and "explanation" sections:
      * Format code blocks with appropriate language tags
      * Structure lists with proper indentation and symbols
      * Format tables with aligned columns
      * Apply correct emphasis (bold, italic) syntax
      * Ensure proper spacing between elements
      * Format links and images correctly
      * Escape characters with a backslash (\) where needed
      * Also, escape all double quotes with a backslash if it is not already there! 
          Fault: ... "content here" ... (no backslash in front of " -> escape it)
          Good: ... \"content here\" ... (backslash in front of " -> do nothing)
    - Preserve all original content exactly as provided
    - Maintain the JSON structure of the content
    - Never modify the actual content or meaning
    - Never add or remove information
